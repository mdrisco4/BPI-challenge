#Blueprint Interactive Developer Test#

###Approach###

My initial approach with this challenge was the same approach I take most of the time I code.  I identified what I believed would be the easiest tasks to complete and tackled those first so I can get the most done effectively and spend time later focusing on the difficult challenges.  I also made sure to create and link to a repository as soon as possible as to keep track of my work and make sure that I could get a few commits as I began.


###Methods###

My first task was to take care of the mean function.  This is a relatively quick and easy task to complete and I knew very quickly what kind of algorithm would be required.  Next I moved on to getting my page set up and beginning on the table and randomization tasks.  The randomization task is a bit more complicated than the mean function but can be completed with a bit of ingenuity, a little research and some trial and error.  
Using a while loop and making sure the logic was sound I was able to tackle that and move on to the JSON fetch.  I took the approach of writing the fetch and logging the return to the console first to make sure I was getting the data I needed and moved on to build a table manually to look like the table in the test.
