# Blueprint Interactive Developer Test

## Michael Driscoll

### Approach

My initial approach with this challenge was the same approach I take most of the time I code.  I identified what I believed would be the easiest tasks to complete and tackled those first so I can get the most done effectively and spend time later focusing on the difficult challenges.  I also made sure to create and link to a repository as soon as possible as to keep track of my work and make sure that I could get a few commits as I began.


### Methods

My first task was to take care of the mean function.  This is a relatively quick and easy task to complete and I knew very quickly what kind of algorithm would be required.  Next I moved on to getting my page set up and beginning on the table and randomization tasks.  The randomization task is a bit more complicated than the mean function but can be completed with a bit of ingenuity, a little research and some trial and error.  

Using a while loop and making sure the logic was sound I was able to tackle that and move on to the JSON fetch.  I took the approach of writing the fetch and logging the return to the console first to make sure I was getting the data I needed and moved on to build a table manually to look like the table in the test.  My next step was to feed the data in manually, this does not take long to do considering I already know I am getting the data I need and I can start working out the code necessary to bring it in and create the table dynamically.

I know that the table function will take a bit to work out.  I have not done that kind of task in a while and will need to look at old lessons, old code and maybe look around online for a little bit.  So I decide to tackle the bonus.  This will take a little bit to do but is more playing around with methods and finding the right combination of methods to apply to the sentence in the right sequence.  An exercise like that also helps to brainstorm, get some clarity and maybe transition to another task that needs doing if it takes too long.

I am able to get the smiley face challenge to work, but it is a bit messy so I clean it up as much as I can and move onto getting the Landing Page up and running.  I find it is best sometimes to change what you are doing altogether to stay focused and productive.
