    <h1 style="font-weight: bold;">Bonus</h1>
    <p>The first attempt was written with a for loop, if else statement and some established variables.</p>
    <h3>I employed some methods here that were specific to that particular sentence like only checking for words ending in 'a', 'e' or 'o' because there are no words that end in 'i' or 'u' and pushing in a smiley face after the period because the last word qualifies.  There is a cleaner way to get there and I could find it with a bit more time.</h3>
    <h2 class="smileys"></h2>
    <p>The second attempt was written after doing extensive research on ReGex.</p>
    <h3>After reading up on ReGex I was able to almost complete the bonus, getting as far as replacing last letters of words that end in a vowel but falling short of keeping the vowel in the word itself due to time constraints.</h3>
